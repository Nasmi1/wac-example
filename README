This repository contains the data and python scripts for running the evaluations found in our IWCS 2015 and ACL 2015 papers (bib below). 

The model of reference resolution is called "Words as Classifiers" for reference resolution (WACrr). 

Prerequisites:
python2.7
numpy
scipy
nltk (stem.snowmall.GermanStemmer)
sqlite3
sklearn (linear_model, preprocessing.StandardScaler)

For IWCS:
cd IWCS
python wac_rr_IWCS.py
Note: this will only perform the evaluation using speech; it will not interpolate with gaze and gesture

For ACL:
cd ACL
python wac_rr_ACL.py
